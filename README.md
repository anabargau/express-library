# Express Library 
This was my first CRUD app done using Express, the NodeJS framework, and the MVC architectural pattern. It was done following a lengthy [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website).

## What I learned
* to use the Express Application Generator tool to create a skeleton website and application
* to start and stop the Node web server
* to use a database to store my application's data
* create routes for requesting different information, and templates ("views") to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser
* work with forms, how to write forms to get data from users and update the database with this data
* deploy my application to production
* design and create my own models using Mongoose
* how to use the async module 
* how to use Pug template language
* how to get data from the URL in my controller functions
* how to use express-validator module
